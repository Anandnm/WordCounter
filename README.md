Word Counter

This Java program allows users to count the number of words in a given text input. Users can choose to input text manually or provide a file path for text input. The program splits the text into words using whitespace and punctuation as delimiters, then counts the number of words and displays the total count to the user.

Features:

Allows manual text input or input from a file.

Basic error handling for file input.
Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.

How to Use:
